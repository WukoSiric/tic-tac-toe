# Tic Tac Toe

Simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe to help me get proficient with Python. The gameboard is just a one-dimensional list. Hopefully with this project I'll get more familiarity with recursion/backtracking as I implement the enemy AI, along with structuring a Python project. 

## Task List
- [ ] Implement board.py unit testing  
- [ ] Implement enemy logic (random for now) 
- [ ] Create working game loop  
- [ ] Improve enemy AI with Minimax algorithm 
- [ ] Implement pruning for enemy AI
