# Tic Tac Toe

Simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe to help me get proficient with Python. The gameboard is just a one-dimensional list. Hopefully with this project I'll get more familiarity with recursion/backtracking as I implement the enemy AI, along with structuring a Python project. 

## Task List
- [x] Implement board.py unit testing  
- [x] Implement enemy logic (random for now) 
- [x] Create working game loop  
- [x] Improve enemy AI with Minimax algorithm 

## Automated Testing 
Unit testing is implemented for most a number of the project's classes. These can be run by navigating to the root directory of the project and entering `pytest` into the console.
